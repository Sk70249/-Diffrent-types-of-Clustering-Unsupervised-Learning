# -Diffrent-types-of-Clustering-Unsupervised-Learning
## Introduction  There are many models for **clustering** out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. Despite its simplicity, the **K-means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from **unlabeled data**. In this notebook, you will learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.
