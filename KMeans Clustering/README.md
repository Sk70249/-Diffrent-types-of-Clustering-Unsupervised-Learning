# KMeans Clustering

## Introduction

There are many models for **clustering** out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. Despite its simplicity, the **K-means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from **unlabeled data**. In this notebook, you will learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Some real-world applications of k-means:
- Customer segmentation
- Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
- Pattern recognition
- Machine learning
- Data compression


In this notebook we practice k-means clustering with 2 examples:
- k-means on a random generated dataset
- Using k-means for customer segmentation

Imagine that you have a customer dataset, and you need to apply customer segmentation on this historical data.
Customer segmentationÂ is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources. For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. A business task is to retaining those customers. Another group might include customers from non-profit organizations. And so on.

### Now, lets look at the distribution of customers based on their - Age and Income:

### Now, lets look at the distribution of customers based on their - Education, Age and Income:
